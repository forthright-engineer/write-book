    A deep dive into OpenPGP for engineers, covering quantum-resistant key generation, cryptographic fundamentals, and real-world applications. This book bridges theory and practice, enabling readers to implement OpenPGP securely for email, file storage, chat, and beyond. It emphasizes verifiable trust, operational security, and independence from government-backed standards (e.g., NIST).

  goals_for_reader: |
    - "Proficiency: Generate, manage, and use OpenPGP keys (including quantum-resistant algorithms) with confidence.
    - "Understanding: Grasp the mathematics behind key generation, signing, encryption, and decryption.
    - "Operational Security: Adopt best practices for key storage, backup, and usage to mitigate risks.
    - "Practical Skills: Use OpenPGP in email clients, file encryption, and chat applications (e.g., family group chats).
    - "Verification: Test claims through hands-on examples, including DNS proofs (e.g., `openpgp4fpr`), key revocation, and cross-platform compatibility.
    - "Privacy: Leverage OpenPGP for daily use while minimizing exposure to surveillance or compromise.

  target_audience: |
    - "Primary: IT engineers with basic coding/cryptography knowledge who demand rigorous, testable explanations.
    - "Secondary: Privacy-conscious users seeking advanced OpenPGP applications (e.g., encrypted family chats, secure file sharing).
    - "Mindset: "Trust but verify"â€”readers will validate concepts through commands, code snippets, and real-world scenarios.

  tone_and_style: |
    - "Clear and Pragmatic: Avoid unnecessary jargon; define terms like "ECC" or "post-quantum cryptography" in context.
    - "Hands-On: Include terminal commands, configuration files, and troubleshooting tips for Linux/macOS/Windows.
    - "Skeptical-Friendly: Address common misconceptions (e.g., "Is RSA still safe?") with data and alternatives.
    - "Example-Driven: Use case studies (e.g., encrypting a family chat, publishing proofs to DNS).
